# Advanced Calculator

### Description

**Advanced Calculator** is a Python-based command-line calculator designed to perform a variety of arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations. It accepts free-form expressions from the user, evaluates them safely, and supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as advanced functions such as square root, logarithms, sine, and cosine.

This program is ideal for students and developers looking to understand expression parsing, error handling, and the use of Python's math library in a simple interactive environment.

### Features

- **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Exponentiation (**), Modulo (%)
- **Advanced Functions:** Square root (`sqrt(x)`), Natural logarithm (`log(x)`), Logarithm base 10 (`log10(x)`), Sine (`sin(x)`), Cosine (`cos(x)`)
- **Supports Parentheses:** For complex expressions and operation precedence
- **User-friendly:** Enter full expressions directly (e.g., `3 + 4 * 2`, `sin(pi/2)`)
- **Error Handling:** Detects division by zero and invalid input gracefully
- **Exit Commands:** Type `exit` or `quit` to end the program
